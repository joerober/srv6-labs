# SRv6-Labs Large Topologies

### Description:
This directory consists of several larger SRv6 lab scenarios involving different containerized routers (XRd, c8000-emulator, etc.) and topology building tools such as Containerlab or KNE

SRv6-labs have been tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 bare-metal and VM. Most likely other flavors of Linux will work
