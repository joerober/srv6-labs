# SRv6-Labs Starter Topologies

### Description: 
This directory consists of several small SRv6 lab scenarios for getting started with different containerized routers (XRd, c8000-emulator, etc.) and topology building tools suck as Containerlab or KNE

SRv6-labs have been tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 bare-metal and VM. Most likely other flavors of Linux will work
