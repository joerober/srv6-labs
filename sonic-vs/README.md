# sonic-vs
This repo contains kvm xml and config files for launching and running a 12-node sonic-vs CLOS topology as shown in the diagram. There are two sets of router configurations, IPv6/BGP numbered and unnumbered, depending on your preference. The numbered and unnumbered folders contain their own READMEs as well.

<img src="/sonic-vs/diagrams/sonic-vs-clos.png" width="1200">

Requirements: 1 vCPU and 4GB memory per sonic-vs instance. The topology in this repo has been tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 host using virsh.

### sonic-vs launch instructions:
1. acquire a sonic-vs image
2. edit the image path in the sonic kvm xml files as needed
3. define and launch kvms:
```
sudo virsh define sonic01.xml
sudo virsh start sonic01
etc.
```

### attach to sonic-vs console port and get mgt IP
1. Find the sonic-vs node's console port as it is defined in the xml files:
   - Example from sonic01 xml:
```
    <console type='tcp'>
      <source mode='bind' host='127.0.0.1' service='8001'/>
      <protocol type='telnet'/>
      <target type='serial' port='0'/>
    </console>
```
1. telnet to console
```
telnet localhost 8001
```
 - sonic default user/pw: admin/YourPaSsWoRd

```
brmcdoug@naja:~/sonic$ telnet 0 8001
Trying 0.0.0.0...

#### the xml files create a management port attached to linux bridge virbr0. virbr0 should allocate a DHCP address for the management port IP. Example:

2. sonic cli: show ip interfaces
``` 
show ip interfaces
```
Example output:
```
admin@sonic:~$ show ip interfaces 
Interface    Master    IPv4 address/mask    Admin/Oper    BGP Neighbor    Neighbor IP
-----------  --------  -------------------  ------------  --------------  -------------
docker0                240.127.1.1/24       up/down       N/A             N/A
eth0                   192.168.122.116/24   up/up         N/A             N/A   <--------------
lo                     127.0.0.1/16         up/up         N/A             N/A
admin@sonic:~$ 
```
3. ssh to the management IP and scp the config files to the sonic instance. Example:
```
scp brmcdoug@192.168.122.1:/home/brmcdoug/sonic-vs/config-unnumbered/sonic01/* .
```
```
admin@sonic04:~$ scp brmcdoug@192.168.122.1:/home/brmcdoug/sonic-vs/config-unnumbered/sonic01/* .
brmcdoug@192.168.122.116's password: 
config_db.json   100% 8426     5.5MB/s   00:00    
frr.conf        100% 2383     3.1MB/s   00:00
```
4. The config_db.json file contains interface and device metadata config. Replace the original config_db.json file with the new one:
```
sudo mv config_db.json /etc/sonic/
```
5. reload sonic config:
```
sudo config reload
```
Output:
```
admin@sonic01:~$ sudo config reload
Clear current config and reload config in config_db format from the default config file(s) ? [y/N]: y

Note: config reload takes a couple minutes, and interfaces coming up takes a couple minutes more

sonic CLI reference:
https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-utilities/blob/master/doc/Command-Reference.md

Some handy CLI commands:
```
show interfaces status
show ip interfaces
show ipv6 interfaces
```
6. The frr.conf file contains BGP and SRv6 configurations. Invoke the FRR CLI, conf t, then paste in the config:
```
vtysh
```
Example:
```
admin@sonic01:~$ vtysh

Hello, this is FRRouting (version 8.4-dev).
Copyright 1996-2005 Kunihiro Ishiguro, et al.

sonic01# 
sonic01# conf t
sonic01(config)#  <paste>
```

### Notes, caveats:

As of May 15, 2023:

1. The repo doesn't contain any config automation yet, hence the FRR copy/paste routine...submissions are welcome :)

2. SONiC-VS and the FRR implementation have a couple quirks to be aware of:

   - L3VPN forwarding requires setting the VRF strict mode sysctl kernel property followed by a config reload:
   ```
   net.vrf.strict_mode = 1
   ```

   - FRR also applies some default settings for BGP and RT values after events like reloads, which require cleanup. Iâ€™ll discuss these items with the engineering team and see what we can do to correct that. In the meantime:

   ```
   no route-map RM_SET_SRC6 permit 10
   no route-map RM_SET_SRC permit 10
   no ip protocol bgp route-map RM_SET_SRC
   no ipv6 protocol bgp route-map RM_SET_SRC6
   ```
